Neuroevolution is a method for optimizing the topology or parameters of neural networks by means of evolutionary algorithms.
This technique is more general than white-box approaches, such as supervised learning, and can therefore be applied to a wider range of
problems. It has been studied in research for decades and has been successfully applied to problems such as artificial life,
evolutionary robotics and continuous domains of reinforcement learning.
In this thesis, we present a framework that implements neuroevolution algorithms and that is used to evaluate these algorithms on a
selection of benchmark problems. Algorithms and benchmarks were collected from the state of the art in applied and theoretical research in
the field of neuroevolution. The framework, implemented in Rust, allows for a visualization of key problem characteristics and the evolution
process through a graphical user interface. Selected algorithms and benchmarks are presented in detail. Results collected from the conducted
experiments are analyzed, discussed and used to provide a series of guidelines for the choice of algorithms and parameters with respect
to problem classes.
