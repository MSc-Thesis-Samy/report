I would like to start by thanking my supervisor, Prof. Carsten Witt, for the opportunity to work on this interesting topic and for his guidance and support throughout the project, as well as for
providing valuable feedback and suggestions during our regular meetings. I would also like to thank other professors at both DTU and my home university, for providing me with
the background knowledge and skills that helped me to complete this project. Lastly, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support, valuable advice and encouragement during this project.
